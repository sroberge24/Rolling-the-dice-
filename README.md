# Rolling-the-dice-
This Python project simulates rolling two dice. Each roll includes an automatic three second countdown that is followed with two randomized results of 1-6 values. This simple script shows random number generation, loops, input validation, and through imported time and random code
This code uses the time module to create a delay for the countdown effect to enhance user experience. Overall, this Python code is a simple way to demonstrate some basics of programming.
